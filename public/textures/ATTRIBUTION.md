`earth_night_2k.jpg` is NASA's "Earth at night" city-lights composite (NASA Earth
Observatory, public domain), taken from the three.js examples
(`examples/textures/planets/earth_lights_2048.png`) and resized to 1638 x 819.

## Changes made for this project

- `*_1k.jpg`: resized to 1024 x 512 (Lanczos) for the orrery.
- `earth_2k.jpg`, `earth_rough_2k.jpg`: original 1638 x 819 maps, re-encoded.
- The other `*_2k.jpg` maps (except Earth night): 2048 x 1024 originals,
  JPEG re-encoded at quality 85 for detailed body illustrations.
- `earth_rough_2k.jpg`: the specular map inverted and rescaled into a roughness map (glossy oceans).
- `moon_normal_1k.jpg`: the Moon normal map resized to 1024 x 512.
- `saturn_ring.png`: 512 px radial strip sampled from the Qt ring disc
  (averaged over 360 angles), inner edge to outer edge.
